### Quality filtering from different sources

# Abstract and Contribution

In this work, we investigate whether the quality scores resulting from different sample quality assessment methods can be suitable for computational workload reduction (indexing). We propose a nearest quality score-based intelligent search for indexing in biometric identification. The experimental evaluation
is conducted on databases of three biometric characteristics, i.e. face, iris, and fingerprint. Experimental results report a significant computational workload reduction with respect to the exhaustive search scenario – down to 38%, 29%, and 31% over face, fingerprint, and iris, respectively.

### Quality filtering from a single source

# Abstract and Contribution

The workload of biometric identification in large fingerprint databases poses a challenging
problem. Efficient schemes for biometric workload reduction are a topic of ongoing research.
Some of the state-of-the art approaches rely on triangles of minutia points generated by Delaunay
triangulation, which are then used for indexing. In this paper, we investigate how quality estimation
at the minutia level can improve the performance of such algorithms and hence the system workload.
In order to reduce the number of spurious and missing minutiae, we analyse the impact of selecting
minutiae points based on their qualities. This, in turn, can significantly distort the triangulation. In
addition, we consider the usefulness of the average minutia quality as an additional criteria of the
minutia triangles for indexing. Our results show that both strategies lead to a significant reduction
in biometric workload compared to a baseline solution (i.e. exhaustive search) – down to 36% on
average.

# Installation on quality filtering from single source
- The code consists partly of Python and partly of C++ code.

- The required packages to execute the Python scripts are detailed in `requirements.txt`. Make sure you have installed Python 3 on your system and execute the shell command
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
in the root folder of this repository.

- In order to build the C++ library you need to install CMake (https://cmake.org) and  OpenCV (https://opencv.org/releases/) on your system. Generate your project with CMake using the provided `CMakeLists.txt`.

- The build instructions depend heavily on your operating system, cpu architecture and choice of compiler / linker.

- Extract quality information with [MiDeCon](https://publica.fraunhofer.de/entities/publication/bb011fd0-60ee-4438-86a0-fdf019082ff4/details) through [quality_score_calculation](filtering-single-source/python_scripts/quality_score_calculation.py)

### Experiments

#### Distribution of normalised quality scores from different quality estimators over face, fingerprint, and iris (i.e. different sources).

![Distribution of quality scores ](images/distrib_q.png)

- High variation can be observed on the Face-based source contributing to the high intra-class variation.

#### Average number of comparisons across different quality estimators

![Table info ](images/tab_quality_info.png)

- Results are shown with a 95% of confidence interval.

- Best results (PR <31%) are achieved on fingerprint (for both capture devices) and iris with a low variability in terms of the number of comparisons (σ < 4 and σ < 2 over fingerprint and iris respectively).

#### Relation between the number of visited bins and the percentage of subjects found for a set of transactions for each source

![Table info ](images/stat_number_bins.png)

- [SER-FIQ](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Terhorst_SER-FIQ_Unsupervised_Estimation_of_Face_Image_Quality_Based_on_Stochastic_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf) as quality estimator seems to outperform the other approaches.

- The earliest chance to find a match in a low number of bins, is depending on the variability in terms of sample quality.

#### Effect of the optimal number of minutiae ranked by its minutiae quality (single source) providing different types of sensor

![Minutiae info ](images/minutiae_results.png)

- [MiDeCon](https://publica.fraunhofer.de/entities/publication/bb011fd0-60ee-4438-86a0-fdf019082ff4/details) as unique quality estimator is used on Fingerprint-based source.

- The selection of the minutiae points corresponding to their ranked qualities has a significant impact on the system workload reduction by reducing the workload baseline (PR<50%).

- It should be considered that any minutiae search process takes less consuming time over a reduced subset of minutiae than on the full set (i.e. “ALL”).
